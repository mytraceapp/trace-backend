# Fix Activity Navigation Instructions

## Issue
TRACE is currently telling users to "press the play button" when navigating to auto-play activities. This is incorrect - most activities auto-play immediately when the user arrives.

**Current incorrect response:**
```
"Okay, I'll walk you there now. When you see the play button, press it when you're ready. I'll be here when you come back."
```

## Auto-Play Activities (No Play Button)
These activities start automatically when the user arrives - they have **no play button**:

1. **Basin** - Ocean waves video + audio, auto-plays on entry
2. **Window** (Rain) - Rain on window video + audio, auto-plays on entry
3. **Ripple** - 60-second ripple animation + audio sequence, auto-starts
4. **Echo** - Visualization activity, auto-plays
5. **Rising** - Particle field activity, auto-plays
6. **Drift** - Particle field activity, auto-plays
7. **Dreamscape** - (Coming soon) Will auto-play

## Activities with Play Buttons
These activities DO have play buttons and require user action:

- **Breathing** - Has play button for breath exercise
- **Walking** - Has play button for guided walk
- **Maze** - Interactive maze, user-controlled
- **Rest** - Has timer/play control
- **Grounding** - Has play button for guided exercise

## Correct Navigation Instructions

### For Auto-Play Activities (Basin, Window, Ripple, Echo, Rising, Drift, Dreamscape):
```
"Okay, I'll walk you there now. When you're ready to return, press TRACE at the top. I'll be here when you come back."
```

Alternative phrasing:
- "Heading there now. When you're done, tap TRACE to come back."
- "Taking you there. Press TRACE at the top when you're ready to return."
- "I'll guide you there. Tap TRACE when you want to come back."

### For Activities with Play Buttons (Breathing, Walking, Maze, Rest, Grounding):
```
"Okay, I'll walk you there now. When you see the play button, press it when you're ready. I'll be here when you come back."
```

## Implementation Requirements

**File: Likely in chat navigation/routing logic or system prompt**

1. Update navigation instruction logic to differentiate between:
   - Auto-play activities → "press TRACE to return"
   - User-initiated activities → "press play button when ready"

2. Activity classification:
```javascript
const AUTO_PLAY_ACTIVITIES = [
  'basin',
  'window', 
  'rain',
  'ripple',
  'echo',
  'rising',
  'drift',
  'dreamscape'
];

const USER_INITIATED_ACTIVITIES = [
  'breathing',
  'walking',
  'maze',
  'rest',
  'grounding'
];
```

3. Update system prompt/instructions to include:
```
When navigating users to activities:
- Auto-play activities (Basin, Window, Ripple, Echo, Rising, Drift, Dreamscape): Tell users "When you're ready to return, press TRACE at the top."
- User-initiated activities (Breathing, Walking, Maze, Rest, Grounding): Tell users "When you see the play button, press it when you're ready."
```

## Exit Pattern for All Activities
All activities have the **TRACE wordmark** at the top of the screen. When pressed, it:
1. Logs activity completion (duration tracked)
2. Returns user to chat
3. Passes completion params for acknowledgment
4. Shows acknowledgment message (if conditions met)

This is the consistent exit pattern across ALL activities.

## Testing
After implementation, verify navigation phrases for each activity:

```
User: "Can you take me to basin"
Expected: "Okay, I'll walk you there now. When you're ready to return, press TRACE at the top. I'll be here when you come back."

User: "Start breathing"
Expected: "Okay, I'll walk you there now. When you see the play button, press it when you're ready. I'll be here when you come back."

User: "Take me to ripple"
Expected: Navigation response mentioning TRACE at top, not play button

User: "I want to do the maze"
Expected: Navigation response mentioning play button
```

## Priority
**High** - This is user-facing messaging that creates confusion when incorrect.

## Notes
- The TRACE wordmark exit is intentional design - it's the consistent way to exit all activities
- Auto-play activities are presence/ambient experiences - they don't require user initiation
- The "press TRACE to return" instruction helps users understand the exit pattern
- This fix improves user onboarding and reduces confusion about activity controls
