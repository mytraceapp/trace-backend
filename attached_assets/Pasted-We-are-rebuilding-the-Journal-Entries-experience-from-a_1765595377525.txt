We are rebuilding the Journal / Entries experience from an existing TRACE web app.
The mobile version must match the web view’s layout, flow, and interaction logic exactly.
Treat the web implementation as the source of truth — do not redesign or reinterpret behavior.
Create a Journal screen with the following hierarchy:

Header
	•	Top center: TRACE (brand mark)
	•	Font: Alore (letter-spaced, light opacity)
	•	Tapping TRACE navigates to Chat/Home (global behavior across all activity & journal screens)
	•	Title: Journal
	•	Subtitle: Your thoughts, gently organized.2️⃣ Calendar Component (Primary Focus)
	•	Month selector (e.g. December 2025)
	•	Left / right arrows to navigate months
	•	Weekday labels: S M T W T F S
	•	Calendar grid with dates

Date Indicators
	•	1 dot under date → activity session exists that day
	•	2 dots under date → at least one journal entry exists
	•	Selected date:
	•	Soft rounded highlight (pill or circle)
	•	Neutral elevated background (no harsh contrast)

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
	•	Dot logic and counts must be derived from existing web data model
	•	Do not invent new rules — mirror web behavior exactly
3️⃣ Emotional Distribution (“Toothpick Lines”)

When a date is selected, show the emotional distribution indicator:
	•	Vertical stack of thin horizontal lines (“toothpicks”)
	•	Each line represents an emotion logged that day
	•	Longest line = dominant emotion
	•	Shorter lines = secondary emotions
	•	Neutral palette, low opacity
	•	Subtle animation when date changes

This component must appear only if emotional data exists, same as web.
Today’s Reflection Card (AI-Generated)

Card content:
	•	Icon: subtle sparkle/star
	•	Title: Today’s Reflection
	•	Body text:
	•	Generated by TRACE AI
	•	Updates when:
	•	A new activity is completed
	•	A journal entry is saved
	•	A different date is selected (if reflection exists)

Add a small refresh icon to regenerate reflection (same logic as web).Log a New Moment (Primary CTA)

Button:
	•	Label: Log a New Moment
	•	Opens a modal sheet (not a full screen)Log a New Moment (Primary CTA)

Navigation Rules (Important)
	•	Bottom tab bar remains visible on Journal screens
	•	Activity screens may hide tab bar — Journal does NOT
	•	Tapping TRACE at top always routes to Chat/Home
	•	No “End Session” button anywhere in Journal
