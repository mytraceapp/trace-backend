## 2️⃣ Out-of-app “TRACE text message” check-ins (SMS)

For real text-style check-ins when the app is closed, you need:

- A tiny backend job (Node.js script on Replit)
- An SMS service (e.g. **Twilio**)
- A scheduler (like `node-cron`) to send “hey, how are you?” texts every X hours

### Step 2A – Tell Replit AI to set up the SMS reminder service

👉 **Paste this into a *new* Replit AI prompt in the same repl or a new “trace-reminders” repl:**

```text
I want a very simple Node.js script that sends me gentle TRACE check-in text messages during the day.

Please create the following in this repl:

1. Add dependencies:
   - twilio
   - node-cron

2. Create a file `reminderService.ts` (or .js if easier) that:

   - Reads these environment variables:
     - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
     - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
     - TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER   // my Twilio phone number
     - TRACE_TO_NUMBER      // my personal phone number

   - Defines an array of soft TRACE-style messages, e.g.:

     ```ts
     const TRACE_CHECKIN_MESSAGES = [
       "TRACE: Just checking in — how are you feeling right now? 💛",
       "TRACE: Hey, I’m still here if you need to unpack anything today.",
       "TRACE: Tiny reset invite — want to take one deep breath with me?",
     ];
     ```

   - Exposes a function `sendTraceCheckin()` that:
     - Picks a random message from TRACE_CHECKIN_MESSAGES
     - Uses the Twilio client to send an SMS from TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER to TRACE_TO_NUMBER

3. Create a `server.ts` (or index.js) that:

   - Imports `sendTraceCheckin`
   - Uses `node-cron` to schedule it:
     - For now: run every 3 hours between 9am and 9pm (my local time is US Pacific).
     - Example cron expression: `"0 9-21/3 * * *"` and add a comment explaining it.

   - Logs to the console whenever a reminder is sent or when there’s an error.

4. Important:
   - Do NOT hard-code my phone numbers or tokens.
   - Use `process.env.*` everywhere and assume I will set the secrets in the Replit Secrets panel.
   - Replit environments go to sleep; add a short comment explaining that the reminders only run while the repl is awake. That’s OK for now.

Finally, show me the exact files you created and any npm commands you ran.
