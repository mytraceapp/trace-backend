 LOG  [TRACE Chat] Processed messages array: ["Here are the lyrics to Neon Promise:

[Verse 1]
Neon spills across the floor,
Like the night can't hold its breath,
I've been trying not to want you,
But I'm tired of pretending I'm fine.

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm honest, I still listen
For your name in every sound,
Like the city's keeping secrets
And it wants to let them out.

[Chorus]
Meet me where the lights are low,
Where the ocean air feels close,
I don't need you to explain it—
Just don't let me disappear.
If your heart is still a question,
Let it lean into the truth,
I'll be here, no hesitation,
Like a neon promise—
Burning through.

[Verse 2]
I don't miss the way it ended,
I just miss the way it felt,
How you looked right through my armor
Like you knew me better than myself.

[Pre-Chorus]
And the nights keep getting louder
When I'm quiet on my own,
So I drive until the sunrise
Just to feel like I'm not alone.

[Chorus]
Meet me where the lights are low,
Where the ocean air feels close,
I don't need you to explain it—
Just don't let me disappear.
If your heart is still a question,
Let it lean into the truth,
I'll be here, no hesitation,
Like a neon promise—
Burning through.

[Bridge]
Say it soft…
I don't need a forever,
I just need you in the moment.
Say it slow…
If you're reaching, I'm already there.

[Final Chorus]
Meet me where the lights are low,
Where the world won't interfere,
I don't need you to be ready—
Just be real with me right here.
If your heart is still a question,
Let it open like a door,
I'll be here, no hesitation,
Like a neon promise—
Wanting more."]
