## Backend Update Instructions

### 1. Update Your Music Data/Database

Find where you store track metadata and update ALL track titles to match the "Correct Name" column above.

Example if using JSON:
```json
{
  "album": "night_swim",
  "tracks": [
    {
      "track": 1,
      "title": "Midnight Underwater",
      "duration": "6:00",
      "bpm": 76
    },
    {
      "track": 2,
      "title": "Slow Tides Over Glass",
      "duration": "5:00",
      "bpm": 80
    },
    {
      "track": 3,
      "title": "Undertow",
      "duration": "4:40",
      "bpm": 100
    },
    {
      "track": 4,
      "title": "Euphoria",
      "duration": "4:15",
      "bpm": 102
    },
    {
      "track": 5,
      "title": "Ocean Breathing",
      "duration": "4:45",
      "bpm": 104
    },
    {
      "track": 6,
      "title": "Tidal House",
      "duration": "4:30",
      "bpm": 104
    },
    {
      "track": 7,
      "title": "Neon Promise",
      "duration": "5:20",
      "bpm": 104
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Fix TRACE's Behavior (System Prompt Update)

**Current behavior**: TRACE describes the track mood/tone every time
**Desired behavior**: TRACE plays it naturally. Only describe when user asks.

**Update your system prompt**:

```
When user asks to play a song:
- JUST PLAY IT
- Don't describe the mood/tone unless explicitly asked
- Keep response natural and brief

Example:

USER: "Play Neon Promise"
TRACE: "Playing it now." 
❌ WRONG: "Neon Promise is about showing up completely, even when things feel uncertain..."

USER: "What's Neon Promise about?"
TRACE: "It's about showing up completely, even when things are uncertain..."
✅ RIGHT: Now you can describe it because they asked

---

When recommending (TRACE initiates):
- Brief introduction
- Play it
- Let the music speak for itself

Example:
TRACE: "I made something for this moment. Let me play it."
[Starts track]
```

---

## Summary of Changes

✅ Fix 7 track titles (all currently wrong)  
✅ Update system prompt to be more natural  
✅ Only describe tracks when user asks  
✅ Keep recommendations brief and trust the music

---

## Testing

After updating:

1. User: "Play Euphoria"
   - Frontend should display: "Euphoria" (not wrong name)
   - TRACE should just play it (not describe unless asked)

2. User: "Tell me about Neon Promise"
   - TRACE can describe the mood and meaning

3. TRACE recommends: "Let me play Ocean Breathing for you"
   - No extra description
   - Just natural companionship
