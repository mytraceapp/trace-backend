Goal:
Make TRACE’s weekly patterns more emotionally intelligent without changing the API shape drastically or overwhelming the UI.

We already have:
	•	weeklyMoodTrend (calm/stress, thisWeek/lastWeek/direction/label)
	•	mostHelpfulActivityLabel, mostHelpfulActivityCount
	•	stillLearning, sampleSize

Please implement three new, lightweight fields in the /api/patterns/insights response:

1. presenceTrend (baseline-aware presence)

What it represents:

“How present was the user with TRACE this week compared to their usual?”

Implementation details:
	•	Compute for the last 2 full weeks:
	•	thisWeekCheckins = count of:
	•	activity logs
	•	chats
	•	journal entries
in the current 7-day window.
	•	lastWeekCheckins = same but for previous 7 days.
	•	Decide direction:
	•	if both are 0 → direction = 'stable', label = null
	•	else if thisWeek >= lastWeek * 1.2 → direction = 'up'
	•	else if thisWeek <= lastWeek * 0.8 → direction = 'down'
	•	else → direction = 'stable'
	•	Build label strings like:
	•	up:
	•	“You were a bit more present with TRACE this week than last.”
	•	down:
	•	“You checked in less with TRACE this week than you usually do.”
	•	stable:
	•	“Your check-ins this week were pretty similar to last week.”
	•	Only set a non-null label if sampleSize >= 7.
For very low data, keep label = null.

Return shape:
presenceTrend: {
  thisWeek: number;
  lastWeek: number;
  direction: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  label: string | null;
} | null;
If there isn’t enough data (e.g., fewer than 3 total check-ins across both weeks), set presenceTrend = null.

2. emotionalLoadTrend (soft “heavier / lighter” sense)

We already compute stress & relief signals to create emotional load.
Expose a single trend object that summarizes this:

Implementation details:
	•	Use the existing stress-related emotional load logic (the same weights used for emotionalLoadBuckets, if present).
	•	For each of the last 2 weeks:
	•	thisWeekLoad = total emotional load score this week.
	•	lastWeekLoad = same for previous week.
	•	Decide direction:
	•	If both are ~0 → no label.
	•	If thisWeekLoad >= lastWeekLoad * 1.2 → 'up' (heavier).
	•	If thisWeekLoad <= lastWeekLoad * 0.8 → 'down' (lighter).
	•	Else → 'stable'.
	•	Build label text:
	•	up:
	•	“This week seemed to carry a little more emotional weight than last.”
	•	down:
	•	“This week felt a bit softer compared to the week before.”
	•	stable:
	•	“Your emotional load felt fairly similar to last week.”

Guardrails:
	•	Only set a non-null label if:
	•	sampleSize >= 7 and
	•	Math.max(thisWeekLoad, lastWeekLoad) > 0 (don’t fabricate intensity).

Return shape:
emotionalLoadTrend: {
  thisWeek: number;
  lastWeek: number;
  direction: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  label: string | null;
} | null;

If not enough data, set emotionalLoadTrend = null.

3. reliefSpotlight (what helped most, this week)

We already send:
	•	mostHelpfulActivityLabel
	•	mostHelpfulActivityCount
	•	totalSoftEntries

Add a relief spotlight object that gives a softly-worded summary of what helped:

Implementation details:
	•	If mostHelpfulActivityLabel is null → reliefSpotlight = null.
	•	If mostHelpfulActivityCount <= 0 → reliefSpotlight = null.
	•	Otherwise:
	•	Base on mostHelpfulActivityLabel and mostHelpfulActivityCount.
Example labels:
	•	If count = 1:
	•	“You reached for {activity} once this week when things felt heavy.”
	•	If count = 2–4:
	•	“{activity} showed up a few times this week as a place you reached for steadiness.”
	•	If count >= 5:
	•	“{activity} has become a steady go-to for you when things rise up.”
	•	Do not include any productivity language (no “good job”, “streak”, “habit”).

Return shape:
reliefSpotlight: {
  activityLabel: string;
  count: number;
  label: string;
} | null;
 Response Contract (Summary)

Please update /api/patterns/insights to include these new optional fields:
presenceTrend?: {
  thisWeek: number;
  lastWeek: number;
  direction: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  label: string | null;
} | null;

emotionalLoadTrend?: {
  thisWeek: number;
  lastWeek: number;
  direction: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  label: string | null;
} | null;

reliefSpotlight?: {
  activityLabel: string;
  count: number;
  label: string;
} | null;

All of these should respect existing guardrails:
	•	If stillLearning === true or sampleSize < 7:
	•	keep these fields null or with label = null
	•	do not invent strong-sounding trends.

Do not change any existing fields (peakWindow, energyDayBuckets, weeklyNarrative, etc.). This is purely additive.
