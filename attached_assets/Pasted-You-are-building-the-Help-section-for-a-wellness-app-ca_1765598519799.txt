You are building the Help section for a wellness app called TRACE.
TRACE is a presence-based AI wellness companion. It supports reflection and grounding but is not therapy, diagnosis, or crisis intervention.

Use the exact visual hierarchy and calm tone shown in the provided design.
Help Index Page (already designed)

Each card routes to a dedicated page:
	1.	In This Space
	2.	If You’re in Crisis
	3.	Privacy & Your Data
	4.	Terms & Safety Commitment

Build four separate screens, each navigable from the Help page.
PAGE 1 — “In This Space”

Purpose: Clearly explain what TRACE is and is not without sounding clinical.

Tone: Grounded, human, reassuring, not defensive.

Content structure:
	•	Header: In This Space
	•	Subheader: What TRACE can and can’t do.

Body copy (use this voice, not exact text):
	•	TRACE is a space for reflection, grounding, and emotional awareness.
	•	TRACE listens, responds gently, and helps users slow down.
	•	TRACE does not diagnose, treat, or replace professional care.
	•	TRACE encourages noticing, not fixing.
	•	TRACE is designed for moments, not emergencies.

End with a soft reassurance line like:

“You don’t need to be ‘doing it right’ here.”
PAGE 2 — “If You’re in Crisis”

Purpose: Safety compliance without fear-based language.

Tone: Calm, direct, caring.

Content structure:
	•	Header: If You’re in Crisis
	•	Subheader: Immediate options when things feel unsafe.

Requirements:
	•	State clearly that TRACE is not for crisis support
	•	Encourage reaching out to real-world help
	•	Include US & international guidance

Suggested sections:
	•	“If you’re feeling unsafe right now…”
	•	“You deserve real-time human support.”

Crisis resources (must include):
	•	🇺🇸 Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
	•	🌍 “If you’re outside the U.S., local emergency services or a trusted person nearby.”

End with:

“TRACE will still be here when you’re safe.”
PAGE 3 — “Privacy & Your Data”

Purpose: Trust-building, plain-language privacy.

Tone: Transparent, non-legal, human.

Content structure:
	•	Header: Privacy & Your Data
	•	Subheader: How your words are protected.

Key points to include:
	•	Entries belong to the user
	•	Data is not sold or used for ads
	•	AI responses are generated to support reflection, not profiling
	•	Users can delete entries
	•	Minimal data collection

Use friendly language like:

“What you write stays yours.”

Avoid dense legal formatting — this is a human explanation, not the full policy.
PAGE 4 — “Terms & Safety Commitment”

Purpose: Soft legal grounding.

Tone: Clear, respectful, not intimidating.

Content structure:
	•	Header: Terms & Safety Commitment
	•	Subheader: The serious stuff, explained simply.

Include:
	•	TRACE is for personal reflection and wellness
	•	Not medical or mental health treatment
	•	Use at your own discretion
	•	Commitment to user safety, privacy, and transparency

End with a values-based line:

“We built TRACE to support care, not replace it.”
