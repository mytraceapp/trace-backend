Goal: Add an optional visual state to the rain activity screen that hides the orb and reduces visual stimulation for users who prefer a more minimal experience.

Feature Name

Quiet Mode

Trigger / UI Placement
	•	Small toggle icon in the upper corner of the rain session screen (moon icon or “• • •”)
	•	One tap toggles between:
	•	Default Mode (orb + rain + standard brightness)
	•	Quiet Mode (no orb, reduced motion, darker video)

Behavior Requirements

Default Mode
	•	Shows the orb
	•	Uses the current rain video and brightness
	•	UI stays unchanged

Quiet Mode
	•	Orb is hidden or fully transparent (no movement, no glow)
	•	Rain video dimmed by +10% to +20% (exact amount adjustable after UX review)
	•	Video saturation reduced slightly so visuals feel softer
	•	No additional UI motion or gradients

Transitions
	•	Smooth fade between states (no abrupt change)
	•	State remains persistent for that session
	•	Does NOT auto-save globally unless user wants

Accessibility
	•	Default mode remains visually expressive
	•	Quiet Mode = sensory-low, sleep-friendly

Notes
	•	This is not a new screen — it’s a state toggle for the same activity screen
	•	No new backend work required
	•	One boolean is enough:
quietMode = true/false

⸻

DEV ACCEPTANCE CONDITIONS

The feature is complete if:
	•	user can toggle Quiet Mode on/off within the Window activity screen
	•	toggle hides orb completely
	•	brightness + saturation are reduced in Quiet Mode
	•	rain video remains playing
	•	UI stays readable and uncluttered
	•	no flicker or abrupt transitions during toggle

⸻

COPY (light and gentle)

When user toggles Quiet Mode, optional micro-toast:

“Quiet visuals on.”
or
“Visuals dimmed.”

When toggled back:

“Back to normal mode.”

(no intrusive modals)

WHY I MADE IT THIS SPECIFIC
	•	Keeps engineering effort small
	•	Keeps UI logic simple
	•	No new feature screens
	•	No backend
	•	No risk to performance
	•	No confusion for user

This is literally one state flag + conditional rendering.

⭐ OPTIONAL: ICON INSTRUCTIONS

Use a simple moon icon for Quiet Mode:
	•	moon = sensory minimal
	•	universally understood
	•	no words needed

Default: moon outline
Quiet mode ON: moon filled
