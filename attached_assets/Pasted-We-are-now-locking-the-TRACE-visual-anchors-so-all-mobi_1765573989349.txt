We are now locking the TRACE visual anchors so all mobile screens feel consistent while allowing intentional variation.

Only edit files inside /mobile.

The TRACE wordmark must be treated as a brand signature, not general typography.

Lock the following:
	•	Font family: Alore
	•	Font size
	•	Letter spacing
	•	Opacity/color
	•	Vertical placement relative to the top safe area
	•	Spacing between TRACE and the screen title

The TRACE wordmark must render identically on all screens unless explicitly overridden for a full-screen immersive experience.

Do not use Alore anywhere else in the UI.

Experiential typography (primary system)

Use Canela Thin as the primary serif for all experiential text.

Define and lock these typography roles:
	•	screenTitle (e.g. “Activities”)
	•	cardTitle
	•	bodyText
	•	metaText (durations, hints, secondary labels)

Font sizes may vary slightly per screen, but:
	•	Font family
	•	Weight philosophy
	•	Hierarchy
must remain consistent.

Create a centralized typography definition (e.g. /mobile/constants/typography.ts) and use it everywhere.

Cards are a defining TRACE primitive.

Lock:
	•	Corner radius
	•	Shadow philosophy (very soft, low contrast)
	•	Padding system
	•	Icon container style (circular, muted, consistent size)

Cards may vary in height and content but must always feel like the same family.

TRACE screens must never use flat white.

Lock:
	•	Subtle warm vertical gradient
	•	Top slightly lighter, bottom slightly deeper
	•	Atmospheric, barely noticeable

Intensity may vary per screen, but the gradient philosophy is constant.
Create centralized design constants:
	•	/mobile/constants/colors.ts
	•	/mobile/constants/typography.ts
	•	/mobile/constants/spacing.ts
	•	/mobile/constants/radius.ts
	•	/mobile/constants/shadows.ts
	2.	Refactor the Activities screen to fully comply.

REPORT BACK WITH
	•	Files created/edited under /mobile
	•	Confirmation that:
	•	TRACE wordmark uses Alore only
	•	Experiential text uses Canela Thin
	•	Any intentional variations that remain

Proceed now with lock-in only.
