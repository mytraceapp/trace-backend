Create a new React component at:
Beta-vsafe1zip/src/components/PatternsFullReport.tsx

This component should:

1. Accept the current userId as a prop or fetch it internally using the same logic used in ChatScreen and PatternsScreen.

2. On mount:
   - silently call saveLastHourStitch(userId)
   - fetch:
     - getLastHourSummary(userId)
     - last 7 emotional_stitches rows for that user, sorted by summary_date descending

3. Using this emotional data, generate gentle narrative strings that:
   - do NOT show metrics, counts, or percentages
   - summarize:
     - today’s emotional tone
     - last hour reflection
     - weekly rhythm
     - stress echo if applicable
   - choosing between grounded, supportive paragraphs using simple conditions:
     - arc === "softening" → softening language
     - arc === "rising" OR avgIntensity >= 3 → activated language
     - steady → steadiness language
     - heavyish day this week → stress echo language

4. Render the narrative in a column, with:
   - <h2> or card titles for each section
   - <p> for each emotional paragraph
   - muted, soft text styling (no analytics look)
   - small top/bottom margins

5. At the bottom, render exactly one journaling whisper chosen using the same conditions as before, as a muted italic text block.

6. Do NOT add charts, buttons, interactive UI, or bright visual components.
   Keep this page entirely narrative and reflective, like a gentle emotional report.

7. At the end, show an optional journaling input section:
   - A small text area
   - A “Save Reflection” button
   - When submitted, save reflection as a new assistant journaling message using saveTraceMessage(...)
   - emotion: "calm"
   - intensity: 1
   - Zero pushing — the journaling input should feel like soft availability, not a call to action.

8. After building this component, add a simple navigation button in PatternsScreen:
   - “View Full Report”
   - Clicking it routes to PatternsFullReport
   - No additional complexity.

Make sure tone stays:
- grounded
- validating
- non-diagnostic
- gentle
- gender-neutral
- narrative, not analytic.
