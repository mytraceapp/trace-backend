TRACE Chat Play-By-Play Timeline — From Welcome → First User Reply → Chat Bubbles (Report Only, No Code Changes)

I need a step-by-step action timeline of what happens on the Chat/Home screen from the moment the screen mounts until after the user replies to the welcome message and the chat bubbles UI begins.

Rules
	•	Do NOT change any code.
	•	Do NOT refactor.
	•	Only inspect and explain the current behavior as implemented.
	•	Give a play-by-play with triggers, state changes, and UI changes.

Scope
	•	Screen: mobile/app/(tabs)/chat.tsx (and any helpers it calls).
	•	Include any relevant components/services it uses (api, storage, message rendering, typing).

Deliverable: a timeline with timestamps (relative), like:
	•	T+0ms: …
	•	T+2000ms: …
	•	T+Xms: …

You must answer these exactly:
	1.	Welcome lifecycle

	•	When does the welcome message content get fetched vs displayed?
	•	What state variables control it (ex: greeting, displayed, flags)?
	•	What appears on screen before welcome starts (is there “Loading…” or empty)?
	•	When does the typewriter begin and end?
	•	When the user sends their first message:
	•	Does the welcome stay on screen, fade, get replaced, or move?
	•	What code path causes it to disappear (or not)?
	•	Is it still stored anywhere after first send?

	2.	First user message

	•	What happens immediately when the user taps Send:
	•	input state updates
	•	message list state updates
	•	any “thinking delay”
	•	network call timing
	•	Does the UI show the user bubble instantly or after something?

	3.	How chat bubbles start

	•	Precisely when does the app switch from the “welcome layout” (orb + centered text) to “chat mode” (scroll view + bubbles)?
	•	What conditional logic triggers the bubbles (e.g., messages.length > 0, hasStartedChat, etc.)?
	•	Is the welcome message converted into a “system/assistant” bubble, or is it a separate header-only text?

	4.	Trace reply

	•	When the /api/chat request fires relative to first send.
	•	When the response is received vs when it is rendered.
	•	Any delay between receiving the response and showing the assistant bubble.

	5.	Persistence

	•	What gets saved:
	•	does the welcome get saved to history or not?
	•	does the first user message get saved immediately?
	•	what key/table is used?
	•	When it saves (before/after response).

Output format
	•	A single “play-by-play timeline”
	•	Then a short “state map” section listing the key state vars and what they control
	•	Include file paths and line references for each major step (just enough to verify)
