BACKEND INTEGRATION: Dreamscape Secondary Track Support

Mobile has implemented dual Dreamscape tracks with intelligent selection. Backend needs to:

1. UPDATE ACTIVITY LOGGING
File: server/routes/activities.js (or wherever /api/activities/log endpoint is)

When activity.label === "Dreamscape", accept and store optional metadata:
- dreamscapeTrack: "dreamscape_default" | "dreamscape_footsteps"
- selectionMode: "random" | "fixed"
- selectionSource: "activities" | "chat_offered" | "user_requested"

Store in activities.meta JSON field:
{
  "dreamscapeTrack": "dreamscape_footsteps",
  "selectionMode": "fixed",
  "selectionSource": "chat_offered"
}

Example log request from mobile:
POST /api/activities/log
{
  "userId": "...",
  "kind": "reflection",
  "label": "Dreamscape",
  "durationMinutes": 8.5,
  "sourceScreen": "dreamscape",
  "meta": {
    "dreamscapeTrack": "dreamscape_footsteps",
    "selectionMode": "random",
    "selectionSource": "activities"
  }
}

2. CHAT INTEGRATION (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
When TRACE suggests Dreamscape in chat responses, include mood assessment in activity suggestion:

Example chat response format:
{
  "message": "Let's step into Dreamscape together...",
  "suggestedActivity": {
    "name": "dreamscape",
    "target": "anxious"  // or "restless", "overwhelmed", "sad", "tender", etc.
  }
}

This allows mobile to select appropriate track via pickDreamscapeTrackForMood(target).

3. ANALYTICS QUERY (FUTURE)
Add endpoint to analyze track preferences:
GET /api/analytics/dreamscape-tracks?userId={id}

Return:
{
  "totalSessions": 45,
  "byTrack": {
    "dreamscape_default": { count: 28, avgDuration: 9.2 },
    "dreamscape_footsteps": { count: 17, avgDuration: 7.8 }
  },
  "bySource": {
    "activities": { count: 30, "dreamscape_default": 15, "dreamscape_footsteps": 15 },
    "chat_offered": { count: 12, "dreamscape_default": 10, "dreamscape_footsteps": 2 },
    "user_requested": { count: 3, "dreamscape_footsteps": 3 }
  }
}

TESTING CHECKLIST:
✓ Activity log accepts meta.dreamscapeTrack field
✓ Activities table stores JSON metadata correctly
✓ Chat can suggest dreamscape with mood target
✓ No breaking changes to existing Dreamscape logs (backward compatible)

MOBILE CONTRACT (already implemented):
- Always sends dreamscapeTrack, selectionMode, selectionSource in activity completion
- Parses chat suggestedActivity.target for mood-based selection
- Falls back to default track if backend doesn't provide target

NO MOBILE CHANGES NEEDED - this is purely backend data capture and optional chat enhancement.
