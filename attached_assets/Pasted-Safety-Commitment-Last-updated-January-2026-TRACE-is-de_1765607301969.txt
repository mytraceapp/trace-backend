Safety Commitment
Last updated: January 2026

TRACE is designed to support emotional well-being, reflection, and personal clarity. We care deeply about your safety. This policy explains what TRACE can and cannot do, and the commitments we make to protect you.

1. TRACE is a Wellness Companion — Not a Clinician
TRACE provides emotional support, grounding tools, journaling, and guided reflection. However:

TRACE is not a substitute for therapy, counseling, or medical care.
TRACE cannot diagnose conditions or give medical, legal, or crisis advice.
TRACE should be used to support your wellness, not replace professional help.
2. Crisis Safety
If you ever feel unsafe, overwhelmed, or in danger, please contact:

988 (U.S.) – Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
Your local emergency number
A trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional
TRACE does not monitor or intervene in real-time emergencies.

3. Emotional Boundaries
TRACE is built with ethical guidelines to ensure safe, respectful responses:

No judgment or shame
No manipulation or persuasion
No harmful or triggering content
No romantic or inappropriate behavior
No false promises or guarantees
Your emotional safety comes first.

4. Data Safety
Your reflections and emotional content are private. We commit to:

Never selling your data
Never using your feelings for ads
Never training external AI models on your identifiable content
Encrypting your information for safety
(See the full Privacy Policy for details.)

5. Age Requirement
TRACE is designed for individuals 13+. Users under the required age should not use the app.

6. Respectful Use
To keep TRACE safe for everyone:

Use TRACE responsibly
Do not attempt to misuse or exploit the app
Do not input harmful content aimed at others
Do not use TRACE for illegal or violent intent
This keeps the community and the brand protected.

7. Our Promise to You
We commit to:

Designing TRACE with safety and ethics at its core
Constantly improving emotional-support features
Providing clarity, grounding, and peace—not confusion
Being transparent about your data and rights
Never crossing emotional, ethical, or psychological boundaries
TRACE exists to slow you down, not overwhelm you.
