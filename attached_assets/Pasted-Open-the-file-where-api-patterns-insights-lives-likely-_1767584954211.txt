Open the file where /api/patterns/insights lives (likely server/patterns.js). Add these helpers near the top, under your existing constants:
// Existing constants you already have:
// const STRESS_MOODS = [...];
// const SOFT_MOODS = [...];
// const WEEKDAY_NAMES = [...];

Add cross-pattern + gentle prediction helpers

Still in the same file, under those helpers, add:
function buildCrossPatternHint(stressEchoes, energyFlow) {
  const stressDayIndex = stressEchoes?.topDayIndex;
  const energyDayIndex = energyFlow?.topDayIndex;

  if (stressDayIndex == null || energyDayIndex == null) {
    return "As more weeks unfold, I’ll start noticing how your heavier days and your go-to supports interact.";
  }

  const stressDay = WEEKDAY_NAMES[stressDayIndex];
  const energyDay = WEEKDAY_NAMES[energyDayIndex];

  if (stressDayIndex === energyDayIndex) {
    return `When ${stressDay}s feel heavier, you also tend to reach for TRACE more often. It’s like your system already knows that day needs extra support.`;
  }

  return `Your heavier entries tend to gather on ${stressDay}s, but you reach for TRACE most on ${energyDay}s. There might be room to bring a bit more support into those ${stressDay}s too.`;
}

function buildPredictiveHint(stressEchoes, energyFlow) {
  const today = new Date();
  const todayIndex = today.getDay(); // 0–6
  const tomorrowIndex = (todayIndex + 1) % 7;

  const stressDayIndex = stressEchoes?.topDayIndex ?? null;
  const energyDayIndex = energyFlow?.topDayIndex ?? null;

  // Only offer a hint if tomorrow is a known “heavier” or “high-activity” day
  if (stressDayIndex === tomorrowIndex) {
    const dayName = WEEKDAY_NAMES[tomorrowIndex];
    return `Based on the last few weeks, ${dayName}s tend to carry more weight for you. If tomorrow follows that rhythm, it might help to plan even one small anchor — a walk, a breath, or a few quiet minutes here.`;
  }

  if (energyDayIndex === tomorrowIndex) {
    const dayName = WEEKDAY_NAMES[tomorrowIndex];
    return `${dayName}s are when you most often lean on TRACE. If tomorrow fits that pattern, you might gently treat it as a day where you’re allowed to need more support, not less.`;
  }

  return null;
}

 Update the /patterns/insights route to use them

In the router.get("/patterns/insights", ...) handler, after you already compute:
peakWindow, mostHelpfulActivity, stressEchoes, energyFlow, softening
add:
const weeklyMoodTrend = computeWeeklyMoodTrend(js); // js = journals
const crossPatternHint = buildCrossPatternHint(stressEchoes, energyFlow);
const predictiveHint = buildPredictiveHint(stressEchoes, energyFlow);
const weeklyMoodTrend = computeWeeklyMoodTrend(js); // js = journals
const crossPatternHint = buildCrossPatternHint(stressEchoes, energyFlow);
const predictiveHint = buildPredictiveHint(stressEchoes, energyFlow);
return res.json({
  peakWindow,
  mostHelpfulActivity,
  stressEchoes,
  energyFlow,
  softening,
  weeklyMoodTrend,
  crossPatternHint,
  predictiveHint,
  sampleSize: logs.length,
  journalSampleSize: js.length,
});
