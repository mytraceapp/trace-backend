I need to add a new endpoint to my TRACE backend server for AI-generated journal reflections.

Add this new POST endpoint to server/index.js (after the existing endpoints, around line 319):

```javascript
// POST /api/journal-reflection - Generate AI reflection based on journal entries
app.post('/api/journal-reflection', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { entries } = req.body || {};

    console.log('✨ /api/journal-reflection called with', entries?.length || 0, 'entries');

    if (!entries || !Array.isArray(entries) || entries.length === 0) {
      return res.json({
        ok: true,
        reflection: "When you're ready, your reflections will gently land here. Take your time.",
      });
    }

    // Build a summary of recent journal entries
    const recentEntries = entries.slice(0, 10); // Last 10 entries max
    const entrySummary = recentEntries
      .map((entry, idx) => {
        const mood = entry.mood ? ` [mood: ${entry.mood}]` : '';
        const date = new Date(entry.createdAt).toLocaleDateString();
        return `${idx + 1}. ${date}${mood}: "${entry.content}"`;
      })
      .join('\n');

    const systemPrompt = `You are TRACE, a calm, supportive emotional companion for the TRACE app.
You speak in grounded, gentle, non-judgmental language. You never shame. You never sound like a chatbot.

You are creating a reflection based on the user's recent journal entries. Your reflection should:
- Acknowledge patterns you notice with compassion
- Reflect what seems to be emerging or shifting
- Stay grounded and human, never clinical
- Use 1-2 sentences max
- Never diagnose or offer therapy
- Frame observations with curiosity, not certainty

Keep it warm, brief, and real.`;

    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: `Here are the user's recent journal entries:\n\n${entrySummary}\n\nWrite a short, compassionate reflection (1-2 sentences) that acknowledges what you notice in their emotional landscape.`,
        },
      ],
    });

    const reflection =
      completion?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content?.trim() ||
      "You're showing up for yourself in small, brave ways. That matters.";

    console.log('✅ Journal reflection generated:', reflection);
    return res.json({
      ok: true,
      reflection,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('❌ /api/journal-reflection error:', err);
    return res.json({
      ok: true,
      reflection: "You've been carrying a lot. Even noticing your patterns is an act of care.",
    });
  }
});
