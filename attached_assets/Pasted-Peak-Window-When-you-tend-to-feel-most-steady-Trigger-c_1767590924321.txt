Peak Window — “When you tend to feel most steady”

Trigger condition

Enough activity + journal behavior clusters around a repeating time window.

Template variations

If signal is strong

There seems to be a part of your day where things feel steadier for you. Lately, that’s been around {time-range}. You don’t have to do anything with that — but if you ever need a gentler place to land, that time might already know how to hold you.

—

If the signal is light / emerging

A soft pattern might be forming. Some of your more grounded moments have been showing up around {time-range}. If that changes, that’s okay — TRACE adjusts with you.

—

If signal breaks later

Your rhythms shifted recently. You used to find steadiness around {old-time-range}, and lately it’s been closer to {new-time-range}. That kind of change can say a lot about what life is asking of you — gently.

⸻

🌊 Weekly Rhythm — “How your week seems to move”

(Lives inside your Rhythm Map narrative)

Steady

Your week has been moving in a steady rhythm lately. Some days rise and fall — but nothing feels too sharp or alarming. Often this kind of pattern belongs to people who keep going quietly, even when it costs a little energy.

—

Mid-week heaviness

Your week seems to gather weight around the middle. When that happens, your nervous system may just be asking for a softer landing somewhere mid-week — even ten minutes counts.

—

Weekend softening

Your body seems to loosen toward the end of the week. There’s a kind of exhale around {Fri/Sat/Sun}. You don’t need to force it — just noticing the pattern can be grounding.

⸻

💫 Stress Echoes — “When overwhelm repeats”

If a strong recurring echo exists

Some moments seem to echo. Overwhelm has shown up a few times around {day + rough time}. That doesn’t mean it will — just that those times may carry more weight for you. You’re not weak for feeling it.

—

If the signal is mild

There may be a small echo forming around {time/day}. I won’t assume anything — I’ll just keep watching with you.

—

If the pattern stops

Something shifted. Places that used to feel heavy haven’t echoed in the same way recently. That can happen when life changes, or when your nervous system finds a new way to move through things.

⸻

🌱 Relief Insights — “Where relief likes to land”

Strong signal

Relief seems to visit you most often around {time/day}. You don’t need to chase it — but it’s worth knowing your body already has a doorway home.

—

Mild signal

There may be a gentle leaning toward relief around {time/day}. If that ever changes, TRACE changes too.

⸻

🫶 What Helps Most — “What your body keeps returning to”

Clear pattern

You tend to return to {activity} when things feel heavy. That tells me it’s doing something meaningful for you — even if it’s small.

—

If multiple activities help

You seem to have a few steady anchors — like {A} and {B}. That flexibility is a kind of strength.

Thresholds — When TRACE is allowed to “notice” patterns

This protects users from false certainty & over-analysis.

⸻

🟢 Baseline Requirement (before TRACE says anything)

User must have at least 7–10 meaningful data points across journals, chat check-ins, or activities.

If not → say nothing analytical.

Fallback line:

You don’t have enough here yet to show patterns — which is completely okay. TRACE only notices gently, and only when the signal feels real.

⸻

🌅 Peak Window Threshold

Pattern appears if BOTH are true:

✔ ≥ 6 data points in relevant time buckets
✔ ≥ 45–50% cluster inside a 2–3 hour window

Confidence tiers:
Tier
Name
Requirement
Low
“soft leaning”
30–44%
Med
“likely window”
45–59%
High
“strong window”
≥60%

Stress Echoes Threshold

Trigger when:

✔ same weekday occurs ≥ 3 times in last 5–6 entries
✔ OR same time-of-day window repeats ≥ 4 times

Confidence tiers:
Tier
Requirement
Soft
2–3 repeating events
Clear
4+
Strong
6+

elief Signal Threshold

Trigger when:

✔ ≥3 instances of mood improving after activity OR time window

Direction detection = “before mood lower → after mood higher”

⸻

📈 Weekly Mood Direction Threshold

Say “up / down / stable” ONLY IF:

✔ direction change ≥ 20% difference
otherwise → stable

This prevents fake trends.

⸻

🛑 Crisis Mode Override

If distress keywords appear in recent logs:

TRACE must disable patterns language & predictions.

Fallback language:

When things feel really intense, patterns can become blurry — and that’s okay. Right now the most important thing is how you’re feeling in this moment. I’m here with you.

⸻

3️⃣ Language Guardrails (VERY IMPORTANT)

TRACE should NOT use

⛔ prediction
⛔ forecasting
⛔ always / never
⛔ trends implying certainty
⛔ diagnosis-adjacent language

⸻

TRACE SHOULD use

✔ “seems to”
✔ “might be”
✔ “often”
✔ “sometimes”
✔ “right now”
✔ “if this continues”
✔ “you don’t need to do anything with this”
✔ “I’ll keep noticing gently — and we can adjust together”

⸻

4️⃣ Edge Cases & Safety

If user has grief / trauma markers

TRACE uses slower, quieter language and avoids asking them to change behavior.

⸻

If patterns suddenly contradict each other

Sometimes rhythms change — especially when life does. That doesn’t mean anything is wrong. It just means you’re human, and TRACE is adapting with you.

⸻

If sample size drops

(e.g., user stops journaling)

With fewer recent moments to look at, the picture is a little softer right now. That’s okay. I’ll keep noticing gently — at your pace.
