 DREAMSCAPE ARCHETYPE DEFINITIONS

## Overview
Dreamscape has two distinct audio tracks, each serving a specific emotional archetype. Track selection should be intentional based on user's current emotional state and nervous system activation level.

---

## 1) Dreamscape (Original Track)

### Archetype Name
**Comfort / Containment / Tender Descent**

### Emotional Purpose
To create a place that feels:
- Softly held
- Warm without being sentimental
- Safe to stop thinking
- Safe to feel

**This track is about being allowed to rest.**

### Sonic Character
- Gentle narrative
- Soft atmosphere
- Low light energy
- No urgency
- "You don't have to do anything"

### Best For (Moods/States)
Suggest this when user is:
- Sad
- Tender
- Emotionally heavy
- Grieving
- Lonely
- Overwhelmed in a soft way
- Needs comfort
- Feels fragile or raw
- Wants to sleep / wind down

### When TRACE Should Suggest It
Use this when TRACE detects:
- Vulnerability
- Hurt
- Tears
- Fatigue
- Self-compassion need
- Emotional exhaustion
- "I can't take anymore" but NOT panicky

### Example User Phrases
- "I feel heavy"
- "I'm tired of everything"
- "I just want to cry"
- "I don't feel like I can hold myself together"
- "I miss them"
- "I feel alone"
- "I'm exhausted"

### What NOT to Use It For
**Avoid suggesting this when user is:**
- Panicking
- Spiraling
- High anxiety / racing heart
- Hypervigilant

**Reason:** Comfort can feel too "soft" for those states.

### Metadata Tags
```
comfort, tender, containment, gentle descent, grief-safe, soothing
```

## 2) Dreamscape: Footsteps, Almost

### Archetype Name
**Liminal Protection / Steadiness / Hidden Presence**

### Emotional Purpose
This track is about:
- Calming the nervous system through authority and steadiness
- Removing the feeling of being alone in the dark
- Reducing scanning/hypervigilance
- Restoring "order" internally without telling the user what to do

**This is not comfort-first. This is safety-first.**

### Sonic Character
- Liminal
- Sparse
- Wide open space
- Subtle "presence"
- Calm that feels strong, not cozy

**The user feels:** "I'm not alone, and I don't have to keep watch."

### Best For (Moods/States)
Suggest this when user is:
- Anxious
- Restless
- Overthinking
- Hypervigilant
- Fearful
- Can't relax
- Can't fall asleep because mind won't stop
- Wired/tired
- Feels unsafe (emotionally)
- Needs grounding without softness

### When TRACE Should Suggest It
Use this when TRACE detects:
- Racing thoughts
- Agitation
- Nervous system "up"
- Unease
- Uncertainty / fear
- Doom feelings
- "I can't shut my mind off"

### Example User Phrases
- "I feel on edge"
- "I can't relax"
- "I feel anxious for no reason"
- "My chest feels tight"
- "My thoughts won't stop"
- "I feel unsafe"
- "Something feels off"

### What NOT to Use It For
**Avoid suggesting this when user is:**
- Deeply sad and wants comfort
- Crying / grieving
- Emotionally tender

**Reason:** The liminal tone can feel too distant for grief.

### Metadata Tags
```
liminal, protection, steadiness, anxious-safe, hypervigilance relief, hidden presence
```

---

## Selection Logic (Simple Rules)

### If user is "soft + sad" → Original Dreamscape
- Sadness, grief, loneliness, emotional fatigue
- Needs warmth, holding, reassurance

### If user is "activated + anxious" → Footsteps
- Restless, fear, agitation, scanning
- Needs steadiness, presence, grounding

### If mood unclear → Default to Original
**Reason:** Comfort is safest for first-time Dreamscape experiences.

---

## How TRACE Should Suggest (Copy Examples)

### Suggesting Original Dreamscape
```
"I think you need something soft tonight — a quiet place where nothing is asked of you. Want Dreamscape?"
```

### Suggesting Footsteps
```
"Your nervous system feels alert right now. I can offer Dreamscape in a steadier tone — something that helps you stop keeping watch."
```

## Mobile Implementation Status

### Track Registry
File: `mobile/lib/dreamscapeTracks.ts`

```typescript
export const DREAMSCAPE_TRACKS = {
  dreamscape_default: {
    id: "dreamscape_default",
    title: "Dreamscape (Original)",
    source: require("../assets/audio/tracedreamscape.wav"),
    tags: ["comfort", "tender", "containment", "gentle descent", "grief-safe", "soothing"],
  },
  dreamscape_footsteps: {
    id: "dreamscape_footsteps",
    title: "Dreamscape (Footsteps)",
    source: require("../assets/audio/dreamscape_footsteps.wav"),
    tags: ["liminal", "protection", "steadiness", "anxious-safe", "hypervigilance relief", "hidden presence"],
  },
};
```

### Mood Detection
File: `mobile/lib/dreamscapeTracks.ts`

```typescript
export function pickDreamscapeTrackForMood(mood: string): DreamscapeTrackId {
  const lowerMood = mood.toLowerCase();
  
  // Footsteps track for anxious/overwhelmed/restless states
  if (
    lowerMood.includes("anxious") ||
    lowerMood.includes("overwhelmed") ||
    lowerMood.includes("restless") ||
    lowerMood.includes("panic") ||
    lowerMood.includes("stress") ||
    lowerMood.includes("edge") ||
    lowerMood.includes("tight") ||
    lowerMood.includes("racing") ||
    lowerMood.includes("unsafe")
  ) {
    return "dreamscape_footsteps";
  }
  
  // Default track for sad/tender/numb states or fallback
  return "dreamscape_default";
}
```

### Navigation Logic
- **From Activities menu**: Random selection (no mood context)
- **From Chat (TRACE suggests)**: Mood-based selection using conversation analysis
- **From Chat (user requests)**: Mood-based selection from recent messages

### Audio Settings (Both Tracks)
- Initial volume: `0` (silent)
- Fade in: `0.40` over `8000ms` (8 seconds)
- Looping: `false` (plays once)
- Volume range: 40% max

---

## Analytics to Track

### Per Session
- `dreamscapeTrackId`: Which track was played
- `selectionMode`: `"random"` | `"fixed"`
- `selectionSource`: `"activities"` | `"chat_offered"` | `"user_requested"`
- `moodDetected`: The mood/state that triggered selection (if from chat)
- `durationMinutes`: How long user stayed in Dreamscape

### Aggregated Metrics
- Track preference by source (activities vs chat)
- Track completion rates
- Mood → Track → User satisfaction correlation
- Time of day preferences per track

---

## Future Considerations

### Third Track (If Needed)
**Potential archetype:** Rhythmic/Pulse-based for "restless energy"
- Different from anxious footsteps
- Different from tender stillness
- For states of searching/curiosity/active processing

**Decision criteria:**
- Analytics show one track dominates >80%
- User feedback requests more variety
- Clear emotional gap identified

### Personalization
- User preference override (always give me footsteps/original)
- Learn from "skip" behavior (user exits Dreamscape quickly)
- Time-of-day patterns (morning = footsteps, evening = original)
