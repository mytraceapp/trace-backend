TRACE Backend — Contract & Freshness Fix (MINIMAL DIFFS ONLY)

You are auditing and patching a Node/Express backend for TRACE. Focus ONLY on these three issues and do NOT refactor or touch audio/drift-lock/schema/mode-routing contracts beyond what’s required.

GOALS
1) Response contract hole: `error` field is being stripped by the response shape allowlist, so auth_failure and error_fallback lose machine-readable error info.
2) Response contract hole: `sound_state` type inconsistency (some paths emit a raw string like "presence" instead of an object).
3) Time-sensitive factual accuracy: questions like “Who is the current U.S. president?” must NOT return stale info. Implement a safe, low-cost policy that avoids wrong answers without adding any new paid APIs.

CONSTRAINTS
- No large refactors. No changes to audio system, drift lock, schema enforcement, or mode routing contracts.
- Keep changes small and reversible (prefer 1–5 line edits per fix).
- Preserve existing response envelope keys and finalizeTraceResponse usage.
- Add tests or quick curl sanity checks only if trivial.

TASKS (DO THESE EXACTLY)

A) FIX: `error` STRIPPED
- Locate the response envelope allowlist (e.g., `ALLOWED_KEYS` in `server/validation/responseShapeContract.js` or similar).
- Add `'error'` to the allowlist so it survives normalization/shape-lock.
- Ensure `auth_failure` and `error_fallback` responses include `error: <string>` in the raw payload and that it now appears in the final JSON.

B) FIX: `sound_state` TYPE
- Find any path returning `sound_state: 'presence'` (or any string).
- Patch that specific return to use object form:
  `{ current: 'presence', changed: false, reason: '<path_name>' }`
- OPTIONAL SAFETY NET (only if it’s already easy and low-risk):
  In the response normalization step (e.g., `normalizeResponseEnvelope`), if `sound_state` is a string, convert it to:
  `{ current: <string>, changed: false, reason: 'normalized_legacy' }`
  Do NOT otherwise alter sound_state behavior.

C) FIX: TIME-SENSITIVE “CURRENT” FACTS
- Implement a guardrail for “current office-holder” questions (president, CEO, etc.).
- Do NOT attempt to answer with a specific name unless you have a trusted, updated source already in the system (you probably don’t).
- Minimal policy:
  If the user asks a “current” office-holder question, respond with:
  - A short, truthful message stating you may not have live updates,
  - Suggest checking an official source,
  - Offer to help with background/context instead.
- Make it deterministic and cheap: NO extra model calls, NO external web calls.
- Ensure the response_source is something distinct like `'facts'` or `'system'` (pick one) so logs can filter these.

DELIVERABLES
1) Show a concise list of files touched and exactly what changed.
2) Provide unified diffs for each file.
3) Provide 3 quick curl commands to verify:
   - `error` present on auth/error paths
   - `sound_state` is object or null
   - “current president” no longer returns a stale name and instead returns the safe policy response

no additional analysis, just apply the patches + diffs.
