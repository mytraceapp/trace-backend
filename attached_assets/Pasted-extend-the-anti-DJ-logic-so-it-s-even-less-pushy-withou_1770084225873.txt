extend the anti-DJ logic so it’s even less pushy—without killing the moments where it should offer.

1) Add a “soft offer ladder” (escalation rules)

Instead of every offer being equally “forward,” make it escalate only when signals are strong.

Level 0 — Seed (no offer)
	•	“I have something that fits this mood if you want it.”
	•	No title, no link, no CTA.

Level 1 — Gentle offer (default)
	•	“Want a track that matches this?”
	•	Only if user says yes do you reveal the track/playlist.

Level 2 — Direct offer (rare)
	•	You name the track/playlist only when:
	•	it’s late night + loneliness/insomnia/panic
	•	OR they explicitly ask for music
	•	OR they previously accepted music in this session

This alone makes it feel unpushy, because most offers stop at “do you want something?” rather than “play Neon Promise now.”

2) Make declines “sticky” by type + session

Right now you have “after user declines: 30 min.” Good—make it smarter:
	•	Decline TRACK → block TRACK for 60 min
	•	Decline PLAYLIST → block PLAYLIST for 90 min
	•	Decline ALBUM → block ALBUM for 24 hours (album offers are big)

And: if they decline twice in a session, stop offering music entirely until next session (or unless they ask).

3) Add a “no-repeat” memory window

Even with cooldowns, repetition can feel salesy.
	•	Don’t offer the same track/playlist again for 7 days unless user requests it.
	•	Don’t offer any music more than once in the last N turns (e.g., 8–12 turns) even if time cooldown expires.

4) Add a “user intent weight” score

Make music offers depend on a simple score that includes the vibe but also permission signals:

Permission signals (add points):
	•	user mentions music, songs, playlists, headphones
	•	user asks “what should I do,” “help me calm down,” “what can help”
	•	they accepted a prior offer recently

Resistance signals (subtract points):
	•	user is venting intensely (needs presence first)
	•	they’re asking practical questions (logistics mode)
	•	they previously declined this session/day
	•	conversation is fast-paced (back-and-forth troubleshooting)

Only offer when score crosses threshold and the “2–3 turns later” rule is satisfied.

5) Add “offer cap by intensity”

You have max 3/session. You can soften it further:
	•	If user is in crisis/high distress, cap at 1 offer per session (because it can feel like coping spam).
	•	If user is stable/reflective, cap at 2–3.

6) Make offers feel like care, not content

Micro-copy patterns that keep it human:
	•	“If it would help, I can put something on in the background.”
	•	“No pressure—just an option.”
	•	“We can also just stay here and talk.”

That last line matters: it communicates that the relationship is the product, not the music.
