Update the /api/patterns-reflection endpoint to handle the correct behavior signature keys.

Current Issue:
The mobile app sends behavior signatures with these keys:

eveningOverthinking (camelCase)
midweekBurnout (camelCase)
morningSharpness (camelCase)
solitudeRecovery (camelCase)
What to update:

In your /api/patterns-reflection endpoint, update the behavioral signature interpretation logic to recognize these keys:

eveningOverthinking → "Evening Overthinking" pattern (user tends to check in late evening with busy mind)
midweekBurnout → "Midweek Burnout" pattern (strain/heaviness mid-week)
morningSharpness → "Morning Sharpness" pattern (clarity/focus in morning hours)
solitudeRecovery → "Solitude Recovery Pattern" (calm/grounding after stress)
The request body includes:

{
  userName: string | null,
  weekSessions: number,
  weekActiveDays: number,
  dominantKind: string | null,
  dominantKindCount: number,
  journalWeekCount: number,
  peakWindowLabel: string | null,
  energyRhythmLabel: string | null,
  energyRhythmDetail: string | null,
  stressScore: number | null,
  stressEchoEvents: number,
  behaviorSignatures: string[] | null  // <-- array of keys like ['eveningOverthinking', 'morningSharpness']
}

When generating the AI reflection, incorporate these behavioral signatures into the context. For example:

If eveningOverthinking is present: mention that evenings tend to be when their mind gets busier
If midweekBurnout is present: acknowledge midweek tends to feel heavier
If morningSharpness is present: note mornings carry more clarity/focus
If solitudeRecovery is present: recognize their recovery pattern after stress
The GPT-4o-mini prompt should weave these signatures naturally into the reflection, using gentle, validating language that matches TRACE's voice.

Example behavioral signature mention in reflection:
"Your check-ins this week show a pattern of evening overthinking—when your mind tends to get busier as the day winds down. That's not uncommon, and naming it can help you create softer endings to your day."

Make sure the endpoint returns:

{
  ok: true,
  reflection: "AI-generated reflection text here..."
}
