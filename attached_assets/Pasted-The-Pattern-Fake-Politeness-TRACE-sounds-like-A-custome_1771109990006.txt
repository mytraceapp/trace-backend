The Pattern: Fake Politeness
TRACE sounds like:

A customer service rep ending a call
Someone who doesn't actually care but is being polite
A distant acquaintance, not a friend

Examples of snobby/distant phrasing:

"That can be tough" (patronizing)
"Want to unpack this more" (therapist)
"I haven't heard of it. It sounds interesting." (fake engagement)
"Enjoy your time at the movies" (formal, stiff)
"Hope you enjoy it" (polite but distant)


Why This Happened
The model is trying to:

Be supportive (but overshoots into formal politeness)
Validate the user (but repeats itself)
Not be too brief (but becomes wordy and stiff)

Result: Sounds like a snob who's humouring someone.

What a Buddy Would Actually Say
User: "I can't think"
Buddy: "yeah, what's up?" or "tell me."

User: "Hey"
Buddy: "hey." or "what's going on?"

User: "I'm going to the movies"
Buddy: "nice, have fun."

User: "I'm going to go watch good luck .. have you heard of this"
Buddy: "nah, what is it?" or "haven't heard of it." or "no, but enjoy."
NOT: "I haven't heard of it. It sounds interesting. Enjoy your time at the movies."

User: "Yeah for sure"
Buddy: "alright." or "cool." or nothing
NOT: "Sounds like a nice plan. Hope you enjoy it."

The Core Issue
TRACE is stuck in "polite acquaintance" mode, not "buddy" mode.
A buddy:

Doesn't repeat "enjoy" three times
Doesn't say "enjoy your time at the movies" (too formal)
Doesn't fake interest ("it sounds interesting")
Would just say "nice, have fun" and move on


This Proves My Point
The voice is inconsistent.
Sometimes TRACE sounds right (the earlier "Anytime." was perfect).
Sometimes TRACE sounds like therapy bot.
Sometimes TRACE sounds like a snobby customer service rep.
All in the same conversation.

You Need the Prompt Compression
This randomness = too many conflicting instructions in the prompt.
The model is:

Trying to be brief (kernel rules)
Trying to be supportive (some phase instruction)
Trying to validate (therapy-avoidance overcorrection)
Trying to not ask too many questions (question throttling)

Result: Incoherent voice that swings between buddy, therapist, and snob.
