You are helping me create a React Native Expo mobile version of my existing web app TRACE inside this same Replit, without changing the current web app.

Goal
	•	Keep the existing web app intact.
	•	Scaffold a new Expo mobile app inside a new folder: /mobile
	•	Then translate screens from the existing web app into the mobile app screen-by-screen while preserving the exact look/feel and behavior.

Non-negotiables / Guardrails
	1.	Do not modify or break the existing web app files or workflows. Treat them as read-only reference.
	2.	Do not redesign. Match TRACE’s pacing, softness, spacing, and typography as closely as possible.
	3.	No feature creep. Only implement what exists today, except items I explicitly approve (referrals later).
	4.	Keep it portable: standard Expo project inside /mobile that can be exported later (no Replit-only services).
	5.	Test on iPhone via Expo Go as early as possible.

Required stack (highest quality, Expo-first)

Inside /mobile, set up:
	•	Expo React Native + TypeScript
	•	expo-router (preferred) or React Navigation if needed
	•	react-native-reanimated + react-native-gesture-handler
	•	expo-av for ambient audio + chime
	•	@shopify/react-native-skia for bubbles/particles/rising visuals (use Skia first; avoid OpenGL unless absolutely necessary)
	•	@supabase/supabase-js to connect to my existing Supabase backend (reuse existing schema and API patterns)

Implementation steps

Step A — Scaffold only (first)
	1.	Create /mobile
	2.	Initialize an Expo TypeScript project inside /mobile
	3.	Install and configure the required libraries above
	4.	Create a clean folder structure in /mobile:
	•	/mobile/app (routes/screens)
	•	/mobile/components
	•	/mobile/lib (supabase client, helpers)
	•	/mobile/constants (theme tokens)
	•	/mobile/assets (audio/images)
	5.	Add a placeholder Activities Hub screen/route.
	6.	Confirm the mobile app runs locally in Replit and can be opened on iPhone via Expo Go (QR).

Step B — Translation workflow (after scaffold)

After scaffold is working, we will translate screens one at a time:
	•	You will ask me which screen to port next.
	•	You will reference the existing web code in this repo to recreate it in React Native.

Start now

Begin with Step A (scaffold only). Do not translate screens yet until the Expo app is running.
