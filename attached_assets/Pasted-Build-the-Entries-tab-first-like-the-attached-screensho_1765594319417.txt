Build the “Entries” tab first (like the attached screenshot) inside /mobile only.

HARD RULES
1) Only create/edit files inside /mobile. Treat the web app as read-only.
2) Keep the existing tab bar styling as-is.
3) Match the visual hierarchy of the screenshot: TRACE at top, “Your Entries”, count line, two expandable cards, and a bottom “Journal” button.

UI SPEC (MATCH SCREENSHOT)
Header:
- Top center: TRACE wordmark (Alore font if already configured). Make TRACE tappable → navigate to Chat/Home route.
- Big title: “Your Entries”
- Subtext: “{N} entries saved”

Accordion Groups (two cards):
1) “Daily sessions”
   - Icon container on left (soft circle)
   - Title “Daily sessions”
   - Subtext “{count} entries”
   - Chevron down/up on right
   - Collapsed by default

2) “Emotional notes”
   - Same layout
   - Expanded by default (so we can see one entry preview like screenshot)
   - When expanded: show a single entry preview card:
     - Title: “Feeling Heavy”
     - Preview line: “sleepy sleepy”
     - Timestamp line: “6 days ago · 12:12 AM”
     - Right arrow to open detail

Bottom CTA:
- Large rounded button “Journal” floating above tab bar (like screenshot)
- Tap → navigate to a new screen /mobile/app/journal/new.tsx (create placeholder screen for now with title “New Entry” and a multiline TextInput)

INTERACTIONS
- Accordion open/close should animate (LayoutAnimation or Reanimated if already installed; otherwise simple state change is fine).
- Only ONE accordion open at a time (opening one closes the other).
- Add light haptic on open/close and on “Journal” tap (expo-haptics; if not installed, install it).

DATA + LOGGING (FOUNDATION)
Create a local entry store (AsyncStorage-based) so activities and journals can both appear here without Supabase yet.

Create:
- /mobile/lib/entries.ts
  - type Entry = { id, type: 'activity'|'journal', group: 'daily'|'notes', title, preview?, createdAt, meta? }
  - functions:
    - listEntries(): Promise<Entry[]>
    - addEntry(entry): Promise<void>
    - seedDemoEntriesIfEmpty(): Promise<void>  // add 112 daily + 1 emotional sample counts OR fake counts without storing 112 rows
Important: do NOT actually store 112 items; instead:
- store real entries array
- show “112 entries” as a computed display count using:
   (realDailyCount + demoOffsetDaily)
   (realNotesCount + demoOffsetNotes)
Use demo offsets so UI matches screenshot but storage stays light.

Add placeholder “Activity logging hook”:
- /mobile/lib/logActivity.ts with function logActivitySession(activityName, durationSeconds, optionalSummary)
  - writes an Entry into group 'daily' with title like “Breathing” and preview like “30 seconds”
Later we will call this from activities.

FILES TO CREATE/EDIT
- /mobile/app/(tabs)/entries.tsx   (or wherever your tab routes live) — implement full UI
- /mobile/components/EntryAccordion.tsx
- /mobile/components/EntryPreviewCard.tsx
- /mobile/lib/entries.ts
- /mobile/lib/logActivity.ts
- /mobile/app/journal/new.tsx (simple placeholder New Entry screen with multiline input + Save button that writes a ‘journal’ Entry into group 'notes' then navigates back to Entries)

DESIGN TOKENS
- Use same background color/gradient as other activity screens.
- Cards: soft cream with subtle shadow, large radius.
- Typography: Canela/serif family used elsewhere; TRACE wordmark stays Alore.

OUTPUT DISCIPLINE
After you finish, report ONLY:
- exact /mobile file paths created/edited
- the route names
- how to test in Expo Go (what tab to tap, what to press)

Do not modify the tab bar component or styling; Entries should inherit it.
