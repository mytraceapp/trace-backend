I want to wire the subscription plan selection through the whole TRACE app so that the user’s chosen plan is consistent across screens.

Goal:
	•	User picks a plan on the onboarding / plan selection screen.
	•	That plan appears on the Set up your account screen in the “Your plan” card AND in the primary button text.
	•	The chosen plan is stored with the user and reflected later on the Profile screen.
	•	Tapping Change plan on the setup screen takes the user back to the plan selection screen.
	•	Tapping the main button (currently “Start with Light”) sends the user to the Secure checkout screen for the selected plan.

Please do the following steps:
	1.	Create a global Plan context
	•	Create a new file, e.g. src/state/PlanContext.tsx.
	•	Implement a React context that exposes:
	•	selectedPlan: "light" | "premium" | "studio"
	•	setSelectedPlan(plan: "light" | "premium" | "studio")
	•	Default selectedPlan to "light".
	•	Export a PlanProvider component and a usePlan() hook.
	2.	Wrap the app with PlanProvider
	•	In the main entry file (probably src/main.tsx or src/App.tsx), wrap the root of the app in <PlanProvider>.
	•	This should make usePlan() available to all screens.
	3.	Use the context in the plan selection / onboarding screen
	•	Open the file that renders the plan selection UI (the onboarding pricing screen – it might be called OnboardingScreen.tsx, PlanSelectionScreen.tsx, or similar under src/ui).
	•	Wherever the user taps a plan card (Light / Premium / Studio), call setSelectedPlan("light" | "premium" | "studio") from the usePlan() hook.
	•	When the user confirms the plan and continues onboarding, navigate to the Set up your account screen as it does now (keep existing routing, just ensure selectedPlan is set before navigation).
	4.	Reflect the chosen plan on the “Set up your account” screen
	•	Open AccountSetupScreen.tsx (the screen that shows “Set up your account”, name/email/password, and the “Your plan · Light · Free” card).
	•	Use usePlan() to read selectedPlan.
	•	In the “Your plan” card:
	•	Replace the hard-coded “Light · Free” text with dynamic text based on selectedPlan.
	•	Map the plan keys to labels and prices:
	•	light → “Light · Free”
	•	premium → “Premium · $9.99/mo”
	•	studio → “Studio · $14.99/mo”
	•	Update the main button text:
	•	If selectedPlan === "light" → “Start with Light”
	•	If selectedPlan === "premium" → “Start with Premium”
	•	If selectedPlan === "studio" → “Start with Studio”
	5.	Wire “Change plan” to go back to onboarding
	•	On AccountSetupScreen, the “Change plan” link in the “Your plan” card should navigate back to the plan selection / onboarding screen.
	•	Hook this up using whatever router is already in the project (React Router / your existing navigation helper).
	•	Do not reset selectedPlan when navigating back – the previously chosen plan should still appear selected on the onboarding screen so the user can modify it.
	6.	Send the selected plan to the checkout screen
	•	Find the file for the secure checkout UI (the screen that shows “Secure checkout” and currently displays “Premium · $9.99/mo”).
	•	Use usePlan() there as well and:
	•	Show the correct plan name + price based on selectedPlan.
	•	On AccountSetupScreen, make the primary button (Start with Light / Premium / Studio) navigate to this checkout screen.
	7.	Persist the plan into user profile
	•	Locate wherever the user profile data is saved (most likely wherever the signup / login logic lives or where the profile screen gets its data).
	•	When the user finishes account setup (or completes checkout, depending on the current flow), save selectedPlan into the user profile model (e.g. planTier field).
	•	On the Profile screen (the one that shows “Manage subscription” and “Upgrade Plan / Apply Promo Code”), read the stored plan tier and display the correct plan name there.
	8.	Don’t change any business logic other than plan selection
	•	Do not alter existing auth, routing, or payment logic beyond passing and displaying the selected plan.
	•	Just make the plan choice flow through: Onboarding → Account Setup → Checkout → Profile.

After you make these changes, please:
	•	Run the app.
	•	Show me:
	•	the PlanContext.tsx file,
	•	the updated plan card JSX in AccountSetupScreen.tsx,
	•	and a screenshot or text confirming that:
	•	selecting Studio on onboarding shows “Studio · $14.99/mo” on the setup screen and checkout screen.
